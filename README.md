# MicroYield  
### Save automatically. Earn effortlessly.

MicroYield is a Web3-powered savings application that automates micro-deposits and generates safe yield using Stellar DeFi without exposing users to blockchain complexity.

Built for non-crypto native users in APAC, MicroYield transforms everyday spending into automated USD-denominated savings.

## 🚀 Problem

Across APAC markets:

- Young professionals lack access to low-risk USD savings products  
- Traditional bank savings accounts offer low real returns  
- Users struggle to build disciplined saving habits  
- DeFi remains inaccessible due to wallet complexity and risk exposure  

There is a clear gap between consumer-friendly savings tools and decentralized yield infrastructure.
